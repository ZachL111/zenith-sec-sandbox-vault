# zenith-sec-sandbox-vault

`zenith-sec-sandbox-vault` treats security tooling as a local verification problem. The PHP implementation is intentionally narrow, but the fixtures and notes make the behavior explicit.

## Zenith Sec Sandbox Vault Checkpoints

Treat the compact fixture as the contract and the extended examples as a scratchpad. The code should stay boring enough that a change in behavior is obvious from the test output.

## Architecture Notes

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying security tooling behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The PHP implementation uses strict types and a small namespaced policy class.

## What This Is For

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Useful Pieces

- Uses fixture data to keep policy checks changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for replay guards, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents claim validation tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Case Study

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Project Layout

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Tooling

Install PHP and run the commands from the repository root. The project does not need credentials or a hosted service.

## Local Workflow

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Quality Gate

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Scope

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Expansion Ideas

- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add one more security tooling fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.
